        Atmosphere <br> <br>
        One of the main components of Earth’s interdependent physical systems is the atmosphere. 
        An atmosphere is made of the layers of gases surrounding a planet or other celestial body. 
        Earth’s atmosphere is composed of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and one percent other gases. 
        These gases are found in atmospheric layers (troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, 
        and exosphere) defined by unique features such as temperature and pressure. The atmosphere protects 
        life on earth by shielding it from incoming ultraviolet (UV) radiation, keeping the planet warm through 
        insulation, and preventing extremes between day and night temperatures. The sun heats layers of the 
        atmosphere causing it to convect driving air movement and weather patterns around the world.

    <div class="crust">
        Crust <br> <br>
        “Crust” describes the outermost shell of a terrestrial planet. Our planet’s thin, 40-kilometer 
        (25-mile) deep crust—just 1% of Earth’s mass—contains all known life in the universe.

    <div class="mantle">
        Mantle <br> <br>
        The mantle is the mostly solid bulk of Earth’s interior. The mantle lies between Earth’s dense, 
        superheated core and its thin outer layer, the crust. The mantle is about 2,900 kilometers 
        (1,802 miles) thick, and makes up a whopping 84 percent of Earth’s total volume.
    </div>

    <div class="outer-core">
        Outer Core <br> <br>
        The outer core, about 2,200 kilometers (1,367 miles) thick, is mostly composed of liquid iron and nickel. 
        The NiFe alloy of the outer core is very hot, between 4,500° and 5,500° Celsius 
        (8,132° and 9,932° Fahrenheit).
    </div>

    <div class="inner-core">
        Inner Core <br> <br>
        The inner core is a hot, dense ball of (mostly) iron. It has a radius of about 1,220 kilometers (758 miles). 
        Temperature in the inner core is about 5,200° Celsius (9,392° Fahrenheit). 
        The pressure is nearly 3.6 million atmosphere (atm).
